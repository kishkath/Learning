Coding: Python 
Data Extraction: OpenCV 
- pytests.

1. The project is based on OCR and extraction. 
2. As, we require data from people' prescription and patient details. we need to extract the information from the documents.
3. It does extract the information from documents and displays only neccessary information.
4. In the backend, as the document is collected, it gets extracted and passes to front end.
